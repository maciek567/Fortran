Plots show time measurements (CPU_TIME) of matrices multiplication of different sizes on logarithmic scale. Experiment was conducted for 4 different methods of multiplication and for three different precision types of real numbers. Although there is visible polynomial growth for bigger matrices, difference between consecutive methods is very slight.
